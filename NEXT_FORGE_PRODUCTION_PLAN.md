## 🔧 TECHNICAL FOUNDATION (Parallel Track)

### Environment Variables Status ✅
- [x] All `.env.local` files present
- [x] Basic authentication working
- [x] Database connection established
- [ ] **Verify production keys are real (not placeholders)**

### Critical Integrations Priority
1. **Authentication (Clerk)** - ✅ Working
2. **Database (Drizzle + Neon)** - ✅ Working  
3. **Analytics (PostHog)** - ⚠️ Needs real keys
4. **Email (Resend)** - ⚠️ Needs real keys
5. **Payments (Stripe)** - 🔄 Optional for portfolio
6. **CMS (Basehub)** - 🔄 Optional for portfolio

## 📋 DETAILED TASK BREAKDOWN

### Portfolio Implementation Tasks

#### 1. Route Structure (15 min)
```typescript
// apps/app/app/(authenticated)/portfolio/page.tsx
// apps/app/app/(authenticated)/portfolio/[id]/page.tsx
// apps/app/app/(authenticated)/portfolio/components/
```

#### 2. Database Schema (10 min)
```sql
-- Add to packages/database/schema.ts
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  media_urls TEXT[],
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 3. Portfolio Components (20 min)
- Masonry grid layout
- Project cards with hover effects
- Modal for detailed views
- Tag filtering system

#### 4. Sample Data (10 min)
- Add 5-10 sample projects
- Include various media types
- Test different tag combinations

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS & SOLUTIONS

### Environment Variables
**Issue**: Many placeholder values in `.env.local` files
**Solution**: 
1. Identify which services are actually needed for portfolio
2. Get real API keys for essential services only
3. Make non-essential services optional

### Authentication Flow
**Issue**: Clerk redirect working but need to verify full flow
**Solution**: 
1. Test sign-up/sign-in process
2. Verify user session management
3. Test portfolio access controls

### Database Setup
**Issue**: Need to ensure database is properly migrated
**Solution**:
1. Run Drizzle migrations
2. Verify connection in production
3. Test CRUD operations

## 🎨 PORTFOLIO DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### Layout Requirements
- **Header**: Navigation, user menu, theme toggle
- **Sidebar**: Project categories, tags, search
- **Main Content**: Masonry grid of project cards
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design

### Project Card Design
- **Image/Video thumbnail**
- **Project title and description**
- **Tags/categories**
- **Hover effects for interaction**
- **Click to open detailed view**

### Portfolio Types
1. **Public Portfolio**: Accessible to anyone
2. **Private Portfolio**: Password-protected or invite-only
3. **Employer Portfolio**: Curated subset for job applications

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS AFTER PORTFOLIO

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Polish portfolio features**
2. **Add more project types**
3. **Implement analytics tracking**
4. **Add contact forms**

### Short-term (Week 2-3)

## 🚨 EMERGENCY CONTINGENCIES

### If Portfolio Takes Too Long
1. **Fallback**: Use existing web app structure
2. **Simplify**: Basic project list without masonry
3. **Deploy**: Get something working first, iterate later

### If Environment Variables Fail
1. **Use local development only**
2. **Mock external services**
3. **Focus on core functionality**

### If Authentication Issues
1. **Consider switching to Better Auth**
2. **Implement simple session management**
3. **Use basic password protection**
